    <h1>StenoDance - How To Play</h1>
    <p>StenoDance at it's core is pretty simple. StenoDance is a rhythm game where the objective is to type the lyrics on screen to the rhythm of the song.</p>
    <h1>Combos</h1>
    <p>The longer you go without making a mistake, the higher your combo will rise.</p>
    <p>There are 5 combo levels. Each combo level increases score multiplier and health regeneration by a little bit.</p>
    <p>There are two types of combos, keypress combos and word combos.</p>
    <p>Keystroke combos go up until you press the incorrect key. Keystroke combos grant a 2x increase in health regeneration and a 5x score increase at combo level 5 which is reached by not making an incorrect keystroke in 20 consecutive keystrokes.</p>
    <p>Word combos go up until you miss a word. Word combos grant a 25% increase in health regeneration and a 2x score increase at combo level 5 which is reached by not missing a word in 50 consecutive words.</p>
    <h1>Health</h1>
    <p>You start off with 100% health, there are multiple ways you can lose and gain health.</p>
    <p>The ways you can lose health are as follows: (Unaffected by combo level)<br>- Missing a keystroke deducts 0.5% health<br>- Missing a word deducts 10% health</p>
    <p>The ways you can gain health are as follows (At combo level 0):<br>- A correct keystroke heals 0.25% health<br>- Typing a correct word heals 2% health</p>
